THIS FILE IS FOR LOGGING WHAT I HAVE DONE SO I CAN KEEP TRACK OF IT FOR THIS APP

IT WILL BE PUSHED UP TO GITHUB so nothing confidential should be placed here

Initial setup
used rails new  with no test per chapter 3 of RailsTutorial (aka RlTl)

used gitignore and GEMFILE from RlTL 

for GEMFILE added Steak, removed cucumber.   
then ran bundle install --without production

Ran rspec:install (don't know if that messes up steak._ 
Set up repository in GitHub and pushed to it

used a README file in rdoc style not in md style contrary to RlTl. 
 commit and push
create a heroku app
result: 
http://secret-atoll-3156.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:secret-atoll-3156.git

tried to push but jquery rails 2.0.0 crapped out - need to update gem file
changed jquery version to ~>2.0.2
commit and push again
that worked on the heroku push - we are now in business.   Time to write some 
steak specs.

rails generate steak --capybara
no Go need this first i think
rails generate steak:install
  reult is : 
  generate  rspec:install
   identical  .rspec
       exist  spec
   identical  spec/spec_helper.rb
      create  spec/acceptance
      create  spec/acceptance/acceptance_helper.rb
      create  spec/acceptance/support/helpers.rb
      create  spec/acceptance/support/paths.rb

rails generate steak:spec bingo 

  result: 
    rails generate steak:spec bingo
    
 bundle exec rspec -f d specs/acceptance/ 
 
     result: 
     
        Bingo 
          In order to ...
          As a ...
          I want ...
          first scenario
        
        Finished in 0.08457 seconds
        1 example, 0 failures
        
I don't like this - would rather have a pending status like standard rspec
so i added pending in the scenario and copied it to a template in the same
directory, so i can use it for all specs.  

Now it runs twice but that is OK.  I changed it to read only to avoid accidental update

messing with getting a test to run and give something back - 
used the helper method in acceptance/support/helpers.rb
and just the default page so I can get through to get some sort of result.

This code works, but I am not sure what it buys me.    And I am green enough 
at rspec that I am confusing them - the fact that there is so litte doc on
steak makes my decision to abandon this line and stick  to rspec.

now to figure out how to remove a gem from bundle....
should be pretty simple under R3 - just change the GEMFILE and bundle install.   

But first i added in the prevous thoughts that I had placed in dropbox into mh notes
then I do the commit 

After bundle install some stuff still works in the acceptance.  But I should move this to spec directory

after running through railscast on how I test, I tried to run
rails generate integration_test help_page which generated a page
called spec/requests/help_pages_spec.rb 

good enough we will work with this dir for awhile
but lets do the home page first

wrote a bunch of pending specs for the home page but failed at visit root_path since I have 
no routes or controllers.    

so lets at least get the home page answering

rails generate controller home --no-test-framework --no-assets --no-helper
figured out the -p option for "pretend" - think dry-run is useful for 
 figuring what gets created,
RESULT 
create  app/controllers/home_controller.rb
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/home  - that is a dir.
tried to run tests, but got root_path note found
created at app/views/home/home.html file and now works online but tests 
still fail with root_path not found

tried adding in some includes from rspec and capybara into the rspec, and still getting
a failure - now we find root_path but can't find visit method.    For some reason
those pieces are not getting included in the requests directory like the
doc says they should.
