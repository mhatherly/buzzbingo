THIS FILE IS FOR LOGGING WHAT I HAVE DONE SO I CAN KEEP TRACK OF IT FOR THIS APP

IT WILL BE PUSHED UP TO GITHUB so nothing confidential should be placed here

Initial setup
used rails new  with no test per chapter 3 of RailsTutorial (aka RlTl)

used gitignore and GEMFILE from RlTL 

for GEMFILE added Steak, removed cucumber.   
then ran bundle install --without production

Ran rspec:install (don't know if that messes up steak._ 
Set up repository in GitHub and pushed to it

used a README file in rdoc style not in md style contrary to RlTl.
