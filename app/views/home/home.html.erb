           The concept of this app is to randomly generate a printable  
           5x5 bingo card that can be used
           to play Buzzword Bingo.   Print out several cards and share
           them with your colleagues while you attend your least favorite
           corporate meeting. When you hear the phrase or word that you have in one of 
           your squares used you can X it out.  </p>
        <p>
           The first player to get 5 X's in a row - across, down, or diagonally, 
             signals "Bingo" (in an agreed upon manner) and becomes the winner.</p>
